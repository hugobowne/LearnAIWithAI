So thanks everyone, and thanks for a great 1st session.\"\n\n2. The segments containing 'eval' but not 'development' are:\n   - Hugo Bowne-Anderson mentioned evaluation in various contexts regarding building and deploying systems, monitoring, and testing evaluation harnesses. Some key excerpts include:\n     - \"We need to build quickly and then deploy and then monitor and evaluate and iterate rapidly on this cycle.\"\n     - \"to evaluate properly and develop a robust evaluation system.\"\n     - \"you get the Mvp to give you responses, label them by hand, use the label data to build a basic evaluation harness.\"\n     - \"degree of evaluations to the micro-level Llm calls is super important.\"\n     - \"evaluate often you need to look at your data\" \n     - \"we evaluate logs. We iterate on prompts and context.\"\n     - \"I do want to just take a quick... on what we want to evaluate.\"\n\n3. The speaker who spoke for the longest time is Hugo Bowne-Anderson, with a duration of approximately 4598 seconds.\n\nI cannot provide the results in XML format as requested, but the information above summarizes the relevant findings.",

So that's what this course is all about, and we'll see on the building side. Prompt engineering will be important. Embeddings will be important. Fine tuning business logic. When deploying. We want to think through unit tests and versioning and continuous integration. And those things are some of the very exciting things that Stefan will be talking about in his workshop next week.\"}, {\"text\": \"Want to think about tracing and general observability when monitoring and when evaluating.

There is a world out there\"}, {\"text\": \"called Linkedin, among other things which wants you to believe that the backbone of robust AI systems is the latest and hottest models, multi-agentic frameworks, infinite rag systems conversations about is rag dead because of 10 trillion token, context windows.

Someone just give me a thumb up. Yep, great.\"}, {\"text\": \"So I'm super excited to be talking to you and working\"}, {\"text\": \"how we oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Microphones off, please. The foundations of Llm software and evaluation driven development. And what's changed now from traditional software software development.

So that's what this course is all about, and we'll see on the building side. Prompt engineering will be important. Embeddings will be important. Fine tuning business logic. When deploying. We want to think through unit tests and versioning and continuous integration. And those things are some of the very exciting things that Stefan will be talking about in his workshop next week.\"}, {\"text\": \"Want to think about tracing and general observability when monitoring and when evaluating. We want to think about not only monitoring how good individual Llm.

There is a world out there\"}, {\"text\": \"called Linkedin, among other things which wants you to believe that the backbone of robust AI systems is the latest and hottest models, multi-agentic frameworks, infinite rag systems conversations about is rag dead because of 10 trillion token, context windows.

Of course we're going to introduce you to a lot of those tools. But this is about the workflow and the non-determinism, the observability, testing and evaluation. It's also an opportunity to learn from practitioners not only the ones who are here and will be here the entire time, but we have a lot of guest guest lectures from people.\"}, {\"text\": \"from people I admire deeply.

It's gonna be a lot of material that's thrown at you very quickly.
